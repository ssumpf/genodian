                   A brief history of symbol maps on Genode



When programming against Genode's shared libraries one might encounter things
like this:

! Error: LD: jump slot relocation failed for symbol: 'wait_for_continue'

where __wait_for_continue__ can be exchanged with any function that should be
present within a shared library. The thing is, not all symbols within a shared
library should be accessible from the outside.

Why?
----

In the early days of Genode we started to port things, like the dynamic linker
and because it was ported we had to implement certain functions like _read_
within the linker, while not using the libc - that implements _read_ also. The
dynamic linker version just read the program header of its own ELF file and was
satisfied. Things changed when my colleague started to use Qt5 applications and
ended up to see the ELF header within his applications while using the _read_
call.

Symbol maps
-----------

Therefore, we started to use symbol maps for the linking of shared libraries. They allow to
make certain symbols local to the library while others are global. In order to
make sure your symbol/function is global call:

! objdump -TC <shared object>

and watch out for the _g_ letter in the second row. If your function is marked
_l_ it is a local function which will not be accessible from the outside of the
library.

ABI files
---------

With Genode's
[https://genode.org/documentation/developer-resources/package_management - packet management system]
there is the notion of  ABI symbol files, within API archives, which are plain
symbol files of a shared library and are linked against a binary. A symbol file
contains all public function names as produced by

! nm <shared object>

for C++ methods, this means that they are mangled. So, if you encounter a
function that is present within a shared library, but not visible from the
outside, please add the symbol to the appropriate ABI file.

Symbol files reside under _lib/symbols_ within a Genode repository. An example
for _libpng_ can be found
