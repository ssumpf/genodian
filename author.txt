Sebastian has been working at Genode Labs since early 2009. Originating from a
database background, his interest in operating systems became apparent in 2006
which let him to the then so called _Bastei_ project - that would later turn
into _Genode_.

At Genode Labs Sebastian sees himself as an odd-job man that works on everything
from low level kernel development, like RISC-V, over device drivers, 3D support,
Qt5, TCP/IP, dynamic linking, virtualization, or Genode's Java port.

His hobbies include dogs, hiking, and making music.
