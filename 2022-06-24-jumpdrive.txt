               Pine fun - Darling I bricked my internal storage

I somehow managed to brick my
[https://github.com/manjaro-pinephone/phosh/releases - Manjaro] distribution
running on internal storage (eMMC) on my PinePhone. So, how do I re-install or
install Genode in the future?

Turns out to be very easy:

* Download SD card image of your choice

  ! wget https://github.com/manjaro-pinephone/phosh/releases/download/beta24/Manjaro-ARM-phosh-pinephone-beta24.img.xz

* Download [https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases - JumpDrive].
  JumpDrive is a small Linux setup that will export internal storage (eMMC) and
  external storage (SD card) as USB gadget mass storage devices

  ! wget https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases/download/0.8/pine64-pinephone.img.xz

* Flash JumpDrive on a SD card. Example

  ! unxz -c pine64-pinephone.img.xz | dd of=/dev/<sd-card-device> bs=1M conv=fsync

  (<sd-card-device>: We use a SD card to USB converter and pass it to our
  VirtualBox guest. For instructions on how to to do this please refer to the
  [https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-22-04#Updating_the_USB_boot_device_from_within_VirtualBox - Sculpt] documentation).

* Connect the PinePhone's USB-C port to your machine

* Insert SD card into PinePhone and boot from it. You should see the JumpDrive
  boot logo 
[image jumpdrive_boot-fs8]

* The Sculpt _report/log_ should say something like this
  !usb 1-4: new high-speed USB device number 8 using xhci_hed
  !usb 1-4: New USB device found, idVendor=1209, idProduct=4201
  !usb 1-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
  !usb 1-4: Product: PinePhone
  !usb 1-4: Manufacturer: Pine64
  !usb 1-4: SerialNumber: Jumpdrive


* Pass _usb 1-4_ to
  [https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sculpt-22-04#Updating_the_USB_boot_device_from_within_VirtualBox - VirtualBox]

* Load the _g_mass_storage.ko_ kernel module within your guest Linux
  ! modprobe g_mass_storage

* The log message output should show
[image jumpdrive_linux-fs8]

* Pinephone's internal storage is 32GB so

  ! unxz -c Manjaro-ARM-phosh-pinephone-beta24.img.xz | dd of=/dev/sdb bs=1M conv=fsync
  does the trick.

* Reboot and have fun!
