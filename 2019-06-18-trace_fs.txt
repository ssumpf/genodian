                     Tracing support for Genode's VFS

I just published a new _trace_fs_ component within my depot. It announces a file
system that can be mounted, e.g. to a _noux-system_ instance. The directory
structure of the file system represents Genode's recursive parent child
relationship.

To give the component a try, check

! + -> Depot -> Selection -> ssumpf

in your runtime.

Install by selecting

! + -> Depot -> ssumpf -> Tools -> trace fs

Start a noux system instance

! + -> Depot -> genodelabs -> Tools -> noux-system

Route the file system called _target_ to _trace fs_.

Currently there are not many trace points enabled per default within Sculpt. In
order to add trace points to your application the new _trace_ function can be
facilitated, it has identical features as _Genode::log_.

!#include <base/log.h>
!
!void func()
!{
!  unsigned nr = 3;
!  Genode::trace("This trace point number: ",  nr);
!}

Instructions for configuring the trace-file system can be found in this
