                FOSDEM'19 - Microkernel devroom

The year 2019 marked Genode Lab's turn to organize the
[https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os - Microkernels and Component-based OS devroom]
at [https://fosdem.org - FOSDEM 2019] in Brussels. The devroom has been
established in 2012 and every year since, varying open-source organizations or
private microkernel enthusiasts have taken over and passed the organization
helmet on. We had a great time meeting familiar and new faces at the devroom
and, in my personal opinion, we had an interesting mixture of talks this year. I
especially want to thank the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel - Unikernel]
speakers, since they brought a breath of fresh air into the devroom, while
staying at eye-level regarding the technical skills required for systems
programming. So, thank you!

As for Genode, I like to point out Alexander's talk about the progress he made
regarding Genode's unified virtualization interface.

The talk is available

mobile friendly version is also [https://youtu.be/L83qlU9pQtQ - available].

Also, Norman gave an unexpected lightning talk about the current state of
Genode's Sculpt OS, which really gathered traction.

All talks are available at

main site. Have fun watching and if you feel like organizing the Microkernel
devroom next year, let us know - we would be happy to give support.
