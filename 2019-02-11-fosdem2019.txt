                FOSDEM'19 - Microkernel devroom

The year 2019 marked Genode Lab's turn to organize the
[https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os - Microkernels and Component-based OS devroom]
at [https://fosdem.org - FOSDEM 2019] in Brussels. The devroom has been
established in 2012 and every year since, varying open-source organizations or
private microkernel enthusiasts have taken over and passed the organization
helmet on. We had a great time meeting familiar and new faces at the devroom
and, in my personal opinion, we had an interesting mixture of talks this year. I
especially want to thank the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel - Unikernel]
speakers, since they brought a breath of fresh air into the devroom, while
staying at eye-level regarding the technical skills required for systems
programming. So, thank you!

As for Genode, I like to point out Alexander's talk about the progress he made
regarding Genode's unified virtualization interface.

  Microkernel virtualization under one roof - Dare the impossible

The talk is available
[https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/microkernel_virtualization - here].

Also, Norman gave an unexpected lightning talk about the current state of
Genode's Sculpt OS, which really gathered traction. The video is unfortunately
not online yet, but I will post an update within this article when it is
available. The link can already be found
[https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/microkernel_lightning_talks - here].

All talks are available at
[https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os - FOSDME's]
main site. Have fun watching and if you feel like organizing the Microkernel
devroom next year, let us know - we would be happy to give support.
