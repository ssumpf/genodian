                      Test driving Sculpt's 3D support

With Sculpt release [https://genode.org/download/sculpt - 21.10] we revived
Genode's Intel GPU multiplexer which we demonstrated at
[https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/microkernel_genode_gpu_multiplexing/ - FOSDEM 2018].
At the time we supported only the Broadwell platform and after many bugfixes,
the enablement of further Intel Graphics Devices (Skylake, Kaby Lake, ...), the
update of the [https://www.mesa3d.org/ - Mesa 3D library] to version 21.0.0, and
many new features, we are happy to announce that 3D acceleration support on
Sculpt OS has been dramatically enhanced.

In order to test drive 3D acceleration the Mesa part for Intel GPU has to be
started, this is provided by the 'genodelabs/Mesa 3D/mesa_gpu-intel' package.
There is also a version for software rendering called 'mesa_gpu-cpu'. With
Sculpt OS 21.10, Genode's GPU multiplexer is automatically started by the driver-
manager component. In case the multiplexer issues the following warning during
startup ('/report/log'):

! No supported Intel GPU detected - no GPU service

You can try to add your card to '/config/gpu_drv' (picture below).

  Edit "gpu_drv" to add your card if necessary

Next install the
[https://github.com/glmark2/glmark2 - glmark2]
packet from the 'ssumpf/Demos' depot and route
the 'mesa_gpu_drv.lib.so' to 'mesa_gpu-intel'.

When hitting the 'Add component' button a cat should appear.

In 'cnuke/Mulitmedia' depot there is also a port of
[https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2 - Yamagi Quake II] which takes advantage of
3D acceleration, as well as a port of
[https://dhewm3.org/ - dhewm3] at 'ssumpf'. But more on this another time.
